Human activity recognition using Deep Learning algorithms.

• Fused the data from e-sense and bangle.js sensors together after data cleaning, handling missing data, and resampling using interpolation.

• Implemented Sliding window technique.

• Trained and worked on optimization of CNN on time series data.
